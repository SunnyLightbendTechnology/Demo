What are the benefits of data services?
Data services give IT more flexibility in how and where it stores data. By making it easy to find and deliver data from anywhere, IT can choose storage that is cost-effective and convenient to maintain. For example, data services make it feasible for organizations to store data in the cloud or to use a hybrid cloud for data storage. Once created, data services are reusable, making it possible for the organization to save a great deal of time on future development.  Also, since developers have fewer data-related programming tasks to complete, new IT initiatives can be deployed rapidly, making the organization more agile.
